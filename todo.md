# To do list
(notes additional to github issues)

## Bugs
- 1ejg doesn;t work for key->coords in map, index error

## TO DO
- Add navigation to the spacetransform class
- hook navigation up to examples and to leuci-web
- Add EM maps!!!!
- Clear Memory in admin needs to be implemented
- Long GET link needed on Scratch
- Document leuci-map with readthedocs
- Projection
- Raw matrix slice
- in leuci-map add "get nearest maxima" or minima
- in leuci-map add adjust pdb file to maxima !!!!!
- create triv-div library: I had an idea that resampling could be used on a density map itself. Mark suggests comparing pseudo density and a real structure and thus resurrecting Alcraft-Williams divergence! No idea if this will work but it feels like a relevant idea. In fact, it is perfect for AW-Trivial Divergence. ALso can be used to compare structures.
- Add in the compare function that I started



## Notes
- Start without the navigation getting everything visible typeing in the coords
- For writeup, show also the libraries and the documentation for those
- Interpretation and tools needed
 - bfactors, occupancy, motion...
 - superpoisiton 
 - image registration

## DONE
- user identidication in admin
- Javascript for slices fully implemented, ready for first version
- Make a slice in leuci-map - with just nearest neighbour to start with
- - To do this restructure the libs to have a map (electron density) / xyz (space tranform) / pol (iterp) / 
- Hook in leucilib slice to Slice
- Add some collab pages demonstrating some of the links and some of the simple functionality
- Get a slice on google collab with just leuci-lib to demo the aggregation of libraries
